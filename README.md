## 📋 Description

**Pixel-Eye** is a Python-based computer vision application for real-time analysis of game interfaces. The system detects and interprets visual elements (HUD, status, events) providing intelligent assistance to players through notifications, alerts, and tactical analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

- **Analyze** game graphical interfaces (HUD) in real-time
- **Detect** critical visual events and patterns (low health, ammo, enemies)
- **React** with smart notifications, automated commands, and visual overlays
- **Assist** players with tactical analysis and data-driven suggestions

## ✨ Features

### 🟢 Core Features
- **Live HUD Reader** - Real-time detection of health, mana, ammo, and status
- **Critical State Alerts** - Audio and visual notifications for important events
- **Visual Assistant** - Enemy detection and movement analysis
- **Tactical Analysis** - Data collection for optimized strategy suggestions

### 🔵 In Development
- **Data Recording** - Match logging and replay system
- **TTS Integration** - Customizable spoken alerts
- **Machine Learning** - Advanced detection models with CNN
- **Customizable Overlay** - Adaptive visual interface over the game

## 🔧 Technology Stack

| Technology | Version | Usage |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **OpenCV** | 4.x | Real-time image capture and processing |
| **Pillow** | 10.x | Image manipulation and optimization |

## 💻 Basic Usage

```python
from pixel_eye import PixelEye

# Initialize Pixel-Eye
eye = PixelEye(game_window="Game Name")

# Set region of interest
eye.set_roi(x=100, y=50, width=800, height=600)

# Start monitoring
eye.start_monitoring(
    detect_health=True,
    alert_threshold=30,  # Alert when health < 30%
    enable_overlay=True
)
```

## 📊 Use Cases

- 🎮 **Assistive Gaming** - Help players with visual impairments
